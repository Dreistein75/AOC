# AOC 23
## Structure
* in `src/main/kotlin` there will be Kotlin files with solutions, one file per day
* input-data will be in `src/main/resources`

## Goal of the solutions
* My main priority is not solving the puzzle as fast and soon as possible but I am trying to be at maximum "niceness" of Kotlin-Code
* In particular I try everything to remain functional programming, i.e. I want to avoid all mutability everywhere
* I want to use all the nice features of Kotlin (especially extension functions)
